1st
sub query
SELECT max(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < (SELECT max(Salary) FROM Employee)

Noitced that Having can only be used abfter group by(aggregation), where clause can not use aggregation function like count, max, min
If needed, then using sub query instead.


2nd
ifnull, limit, offset, distinct
SELECT 
    IFNULL(
        (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
        FROM Employee
        ORDER BY SALARY DESC
        LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1)
        ,NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary

Note:
IFNULL(sentence, IF NULL RESULT)
LIMIT 输出几行结果
offset 从第几行开始输出
sql默认升序

OFFSET can only be used with ORDER BY clause. It cannot be used on its own.
OFFSET value must be greater than or equal to zero. It cannot be negative, else return error.


3rd:
select max(salary) from employee
where salary not in (
select salary from (
select DISTINCT salary from employee
order by salary desc )
where rownum<=2);
