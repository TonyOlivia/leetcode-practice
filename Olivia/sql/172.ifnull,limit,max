1st
sub query
SELECT max(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < (SELECT max(Salary) FROM Employee)

Noitced that Having can only be used abfter group by(aggregation), where clause can not use aggregation function like count, max, min
If needed, then using sub query instead.


2nd
ifnull, limit, offset
